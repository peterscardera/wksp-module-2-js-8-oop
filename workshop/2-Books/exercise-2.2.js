// Exercise 2.2
// ------------
// Create a BookList class that has the following properties:
//      - booksread (0 to start)
//      - bookUnread (0 start)
//      - books (empty array)
//      - reference to last book read (null for now)
//      - reference to book currently reading (null for now)
//      - reference to book that is upNext (null for now)
//
// Then intantiate it once as 'homeLibrary'

// Console.log(homeLibrary) to verify that all is working.

class BookList {
    constructor(){
        this.booksRead = 0;
        this.bookUnread = 0;
        this.books = [];
        this.recentlyRead = null;
        this.currentlyReading = null;
        this.upNext = null;
    }
}

let homeLibrary = new BookList()

console.log(homeLibrary)
